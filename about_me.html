I am a Preemie in the coding NICU. I am on a coding ventilator and oxyen until I can leave the NICU.
Once I can breath on my own and take solid food it won't be long before I can take my first steps.

A SPECIAL NOTE: I really have had zero experience with coding/programming prior to taking this class so I am that student of yours who is at a crossroads.
The crossroad for me, the student, is the "experience" of the initial exposure. 
I'm not talking about the initial exposure to coding but rather a safe, welcoming and supportive human interaction.
If the human environment isn't safe, welcoming and supportive then the coding won't matter because I will most likely quit.
Understanding how to achieve and propagate the human environment sweet spot is not easy and takes a dedicated and self-aware teacher.
Despite years of vast and deep knowledge the teacher must have great patience AND an ability to remember that the student doesn't know what you do as habit.

I have been teaching for 20 years, all of it at Timberline High School in the Boise School District.
For most of this time I have been traveling between two or more schools teaching a myriad of classes.

Currently I am at my home school for four periods in the morning (IED, POE, CEA, EDD and two levels of digital video).<BR>
I travel over lunch to my second school, East Junoir High, where I teach two levels of computer apps.
